I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in the department of Computer Science at Northwestern University. My supervisor is [Prof. Oliver Cossairt](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/cossairt-oliver.html). And I also work closely with [Prof. Aggelos Katsaggelos](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/katsaggelos-aggelos.html).

Prior to my Ph.D. study at Northwestern, I was a research assistant and a research-based master student at [School of Computer Science of McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xue (Steve) Liu](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html) and [Prof. Xiao-Wen Chang](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~chang/). Before that, I completed my bachelor degree at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/). Please refer to my CV for further details. 

<b>Research Interests</b>: I have a broad interest in <b>artificial intelligence and its applications</b>. Previously, my research focused on <b>2nd generation neural networks -- ANNs</b>, including numerical analysis and their applications in recommender systems and computer vision. And my current research focuses on <b>3rd generation neural networks -- SNNs</b> and their event-driven neuromorphic applications in vision, audio, and robotic learning. I believe building SNNs with the lessons from ANNs can lead us to energy-efficient human-like artificial intelligence.
